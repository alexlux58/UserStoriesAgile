        User Stories help Software Engineers organize work in a way that follows
        Agile values and principles. Agile principles which state that working
        software is the primary measure of progress. Our highest priority is to
        satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable
        software. Simplicity the art of maximizing the amount of work not done
        is essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achive these principles a team has to sort out features by priority.
        Progress can also be ranked by splitting up tasks in to "to do", "doing"
        and "done". These tasks can be put in to simple stories that describe
        what the users world must look like. An example storie would be, as a
        registered user I want to change my password so I can keep my account
        secure. Another example, as a website visitor I want to subscribe to the
        mailing list for a product so I can get product updates through email.
      </p>
      <p>
        User stories are a good way to represent hte idea of what the user needs
        withought getting bogged down on the implementation details. When our
        development efforts are driven by stories that represent our
        understanding of user needs it supports our principles and fosters good
        development practices. Stories htat are written in ways that violate our
        principles will hinder good development practices. Anything we can do to
        increase the quality of our stories will make the rest of our
        development process more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of a bad user story would be, as a developer I want a
        database with all the tables to model the data so I can store
        information the application needs. This breaks our principles because it
        provides no value to the costumer. Also The information we need will
        only be know when we figure out how we are going to build other parts of
        the system. A story like this is a prerequisite for and a dependecy of
        every other story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software projects that usually fail weren't focused on delivering actual
        business value to the user on a regualr basis. Building the application
        the way the user thinks about value minimizes risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the problems that user stories address are the communication
        problem between the people who want the software and the people who will
        build it. If either side dominates, the business loses. If the business
        side dominates the functionality and dates are mandated with little
        regard for reality or whether the developers undestand the requiements.
        If the developers dominate technical jargon replaces the language of the
        business and developers lose the opportunity to learn from listening.
